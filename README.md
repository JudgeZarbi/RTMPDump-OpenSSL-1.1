# RTMPDump-OpenSSL-1.1

I modified a few of the files in the librtmp directory to conform to the new getters and setters in OpenSSL 1.1.0. I don't claim to be a security expert, and neither have I had any experience with OpenSSL in a programming sense, so I'm not sure exactly if it's correct, but it compiles and seems to work for what I use it for.
